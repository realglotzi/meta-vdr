# graphlcd.conf.sample
#
# This file contains a sample configuration for the graphlcd driver
# library.
# 
# The format is ini-file-like. It is divided into sections that start
# at markers that look like [section]. Comments are all line-based
# comments, and are lines that start with '#'.
#
# The file starts with general settings, that are used by several
# drivers, followed by the sections. Each section represents a single
# display with a driver definition and specific settings which define
# how the driver acts. Some of these parameters like device, port and
# size are already parsed by the library but the drivers can also read
# their own options from the config file. The library passes them to
# the drivers.

# WaitMethod
#  Select the method that is used for sleeping.
#  Possible values:
#   0 - usleep
#   1 - nanosleep
#   2 - nanosleep (sched_rr) - This is recommended on kernel 2.4 systems
#   3 - gettimeofday - This is recommended on kernel 2.6 systems
#  Defaukt value: 3
WaitMethod=3

# WaitPriority
#  Select the process priority that is used when sleeping.
#  Possible values: -20 <= x <= 19
#  Default value: 0
WaitPriority=0

# General driver settings
#  This section lists the display settings that are parsed and
#  recognized by the driver library.
#
# Driver
#  Sets the display's driver.
#  Currently available are: framebuffer, gu140x32f, gu256x64-372,
#                           gu256x64C-3xx0, hd61830, image, ks0108,
#                           sed1520, sed1330, simlcd, t6963c,
#                           gu126x64D-K610A4
#
# Device
#  Instead of using the direct output via port address (see Port), you
#  can use the parport device (/dev/parportX). The advantage over the
#  direct output via port address is that this works for non-root users
#  also. But it's a little bit slower. The modules ppdev.o, parport.o
#  and parport_pc.o must be loaded or compiled into the kernel.
#
# Port
#  Sets the port address of the parallel port. If this parameter is not
#  given, 0x378 is used. To use this direct output, the program that
#  uses the driver library has to be started with user 'root'.
#
# Width
#  Sets the horizontal size of the display. If this parameter is not
#  given, a default one specific to the driver is used.
#
# Height
#  Sets the vertical size of the display. If this parameter is not
#  given, a default one specific to the driver is used.
#
# UpsideDown
#  Rotates the display output by 180 degrees. This might be useful, if
#  the LCD is mounted upside-down.
#  Possible values: 'yes', 'no'
#  Default value: 'no'
#
# Invert
#  Inverts the display.
#  Possible values: 'yes', 'no'
#  Default value: 'no'
#
# Brightness
#  Sets the brightness of your display's backlight if supported by its
#  driver.
#  Supported by: gu140x32f, gu256x64-372, gu256x64-3900, gu126x64D-K610A4, ax206dpf
#  Possible values: 0 <= x <= 100)
#  Default value: 100
#
# Contrast
#  Sets the contrast of your display if supported by its driver.
#  Supported by: serdisplib
#  Possible values: 0 <= x <= 10
#  Default value: 5
#
# Backlight
#  Switches the backlight of your display on and off if supported by
#  its driver.
#  Supported by: serdisplib
#  Possible values: 'yes', 'no'
#  Default value: 'yes'
#
# AdjustTiming
#  To get a timing that is as accurate as possible, the drivers measure
#  the time for port commands (see: benchmark in syslog). You might
#  decrease or increase the time to wait after port commands with this
#  parameter. Normally, there is no need to change this parameter.
#  (used by gu140x32f, gu256x64-372, gu256x64-3900, hd61830, ks0108,
#   sed1330, sed1520, gu126x64D-K610A4)
#  Possible values: -50 <= x <= 50
#  Default value: 0
#
# RefreshDisplay
#  Normally, most of the drivers do not update the whole display, but
#  only the areas that have changed since last update. So it might be,
#  that some faulty pixels would stay a longer time. To avoid this, the
#  plugin makes a complete refresh from time to time. This parameter
#  defines how often a complete refresh will be done.
#  e.g.: A value of 5 means, that the plugin will make a complete
#        refresh on every 5th update.
#  A value of 0 completely disables complete refreshs. 
#  Possible values: 0 <= x <= 50
#  Default value: 5
